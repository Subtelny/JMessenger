# JMessenger
Simple project only to show my experience with CQRS, Event Sourcing and Domain-Driven Design.
Thanks CQRS and ES we can easily cut the project into seperatelly projects and make them as microservices. Using (for example) RabbitMq we would create connection between all microservices
which will be shouting our events :)

## Todo
In nearly future I would to add
- Vaadin UI
- RabbitMq integration

## Requires
- Java 8
- MySQL

## Setup (with Maven)
You can simply build the project by running
```
./mvn clean install
```
Its automatically download dependencies and build the project :)
